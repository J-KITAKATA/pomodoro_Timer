# Pomodoro Timer
## Overview
I created a local Pomodoro timer.  
My motivation was that while there are Pomodoro timer games on Steam, I didn't want to pay for one, and I decided to build it as practice for using Java code.

## Point
* I set it to play a sound when the time ends.
* The ability to pause during active time.
* We paid careful attention to the font size and button size of the timer, designing it to be easy to operate even for those unfamiliar with the controls.

## Upcoming Schedule
* Add files to make it work on Mac and Linux as well.
